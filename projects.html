            <p>This is pretty much all of the personal projects that I think are notable enough to deserve a description. Things will rotate in and out of here, as I make more things that are larger in scope than the ones I'm currently doing. Projects are ordered roughly in order of "impressiveness" and "usefulness"</p>

                  <p>Mako is possibly my first big project in C. It's a web server capable of serving content of all types. Unfortunately due to firewall rules I've actually been unable to test it extensively, but I'm reasonably sure it's functional, as I use it to test the Javascript attached to this website.<br>I really enjoyed making this, it taught me a decent amount about networking and about how the C standard library functions work.</p>

                <p>I was kinda dissappointed coming from high-level languages to C, and seeing that there really isn't any utility for debug logging. Segfaults can just kinda...happen sometimes and where most languages would provide a backtrace or some useful information, C just says "good luck". Sure I can just open GDB and run through, but sometimes it's helpful to know where I'm at in the program when the crash occurs specifically. So I made timber! It's pretty much identical in functionality to Python's logging library, spare for a few differences.</p>

                <p>As mentioned in my blog, this small little project is mostly born out of boredom, but I had fun writing it regardless. The action syntax is a little weird, but can be dumbed down to [action]-x-y. for example if you wanted to Check A4, the input would be C-a-4. The input is the same for placing a flag (F-A-4). Expect a help menu sometime in the future, but I've been busy with learning Go, and this isn't too impressive a project for me to worry about maintaining it too much</p>
