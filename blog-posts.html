                <p>Finally decided to show Timber some love and stop procrastinating adding format strings. It was a LOT less complicated than I thought it would be in all honesty, it only took an hour or so to implement. The C++ version though? Horrible. Ran into an issue where I cant pass both variadic and default arguments, which makes sense since they both overwrite each other. No biggie though right, just make a wrapper function! NOPE. I need to use __LINE__ and __FUNC__ which obviously by their very nature change constantly. The only possible idea I've come up with so far is to write to a temp file via a Macro when the function is invoked, but that sounds quite complicated and also VERY bodged, so it's probably gonna be a last resort sort of thing. Either way, the C version works brilliantly and is now much nicer to use! No more hefty snprintf everywhere, just specify the level and print whatever you need! I know these projects aren't really impressive at all but I love how much I learn doing them</p>

                  <p>Honestly, coding this was so fun. Doing it in C was borderline masochistic considering how much I had to safeguard against segfaults, but in the end it works pretty well! I still need to implement the help menu, but besides that its completed. This small little "project" (it's way too small to be a full one) was mainly born out of boredom; classes at the moment are long and mostly recap, so there's a lot of downtime after I finish the assigned tasks. My girlfriend is currently working on her own version too, not sure if that'll be posted to Github but it has a lot a much prettier interface since she actually knows how to use ANSI escape codes.
                  Honestly my favourite part was the recursive function to create that "cascade" effect when you get a lot of clears at once. I'm a sucker for recursion even if does add complexity:
<pre><code>int check_squares(int x, int y)
{
  // first check that input is in expected range.
  if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x > X_MAX || y > Y_MAX) {
    return -1; // return -1 if the user is being a dickhead
  }
  if (visited[y][x]) {
    return 0; // recursively return if the cell has already been visited
  }
  visited[y][x] = true;// if not visited, then mark it as so
  if (pBoard->true_layout[y][x] != MINE) {
    pBoard->display[y][x] = pBoard->true_layout[y][x];// change the displayed character to be the real character
  }
  
  if (pBoard->true_layout[y][x] != EMPTY) { // reveal numbers (should not reveal bombs)
    return 0;
  }

  int directions[4][2] = { // all the cardinal directions mapped out for usage in iteration. Honestly no feckin clue which order its in
    {1,0}, {0,1}, {-1,0}, {0,-1}
  };
 
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    int new_x = x + directions[i][0];
    int new_y = y + directions[i][1];
    if (new_x >= 0 && new_x < X_MAX && new_y >= 0 && new_y < Y_MAX) { // segfault guarding
    check_squares(new_x, new_y);
    }
  }
}</code></pre></p>
