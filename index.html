<p>Hi! If you're using this site chances are you're either a friend of mine or I'm showing you something. This is just a website for me to put all of my projects into, as listed below. Important to note that I am NOT a web dev, and my graphic design ability is next to non-existent, so this will function more like a "Document Viewer" than an actual website. If you have any suggestions please contact me on GitHub or my Email (at the bottom of the page) <br> -CCynth1a she/her :3</p>

<a href="r6randomiser.html"><button>Rainbow Six Siege Randomiser</button></a>

<p>I noticed that there wasn't an up-to-date randomiser for Rainbow Six, and since Ubisoft stupidly decided to disable the operator randomiser in Standard matches, I just made one myself. This is my...second(?) time making something in JavaScript, and its probably some of the worst code I've ever written. <br> <br> <b>Addendum 2024-03-13: </b>I fixed it, the logic is no longer awful, I've kept the original in there for me to laugh at <br> <br> Last Updated: Y9S1</p>

<a href="https://github.com/ccynth1a/Mako"><button>Mako</button></a>

<p>A basic web server, but by far the beefiest project I've worked on up to this point, and also the clunkiest. Quite a bit of the code has been stolen and malformed from various sources into a Frankenstein's monster of a program that PROBABLY does what it's meant to, but I'm proud of it regardless. More information can be found in the README. <br> <br> Last Updated: 2024-06-10</p>

<a href="https://github.com/ccynth1a/timber"><button>timber</button></a>

<p>Timber is just a C logger library for personal usage, but I've put it on Github so I can more easily clone it from my different computers. It will have a few more features added over time, but for now it's in a workable state and I'm happy with it! Hopefully my progress in C from the safestalinsort project to this one is evident <br> <br> Last Updated: 2024-08-14</p>
