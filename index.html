            <p>Hi! I'm CCynth1a (The first C stands for Charlotte), and I'm a computer science student from the UK, relatively new to programming, I only really started it seriously about a year ago. <br><br>Over the last year or so it has become my primary hobby, and I'm currently learning several languages and working on some really fun projects. Namely I'm interested in C, its simplicity is very appealing to me as I'm not a huge fan of the levels of abstraction that high-level languages provide, though as a beginner this obviously does limit the scope of the kind of projects and applications I can work on. I'm also learning Go, and eventually plan to learn Rust, though it's not exactly the most beginner friendly language.<br><br>I am interested in things other than programming though! It fluctuates, but my current interests are things like aviation history, retro computing and linux! As most people are, I'm also quite into music, mostly metal and alternative rock; my favourite album is probably Nightfall in Middle Earth by Blind Guardian. <br><br>To make sure that I hit absolutely all of the stereotypes, I'm also transfemme, I came out a couple years ago, and have since been fighting the world to get any sort of treatment! I have two Blahajs, Gill Clinton and Osama Fin Laden, and then one Djungelskog called Bearrack Obama!</p>
