<p>Hi! If you're using this site chances are you're either a friend of mine or I'm showing you something. This is just a website for me to put all of my web projects into, as listed below. Important to note that I am NOT a web dev, and my graphic design ability is next to non-existent, so this will function more like a "Document Viewer" than an actual website. If you have any suggestions please contact me on GitHub or my Tumblr blog (at the bottom of the page) <br> -CCynth1a she/her :3</p>

<a href="r6randomiser.html"><button>Rainbow Six Siege Randomiser</button></a>

<p>I noticed that there wasn't an up-to-date randomiser for Rainbow Six, and since Ubisoft stupidly decided to disable the operator randomiser in Standard matches, I just made one myself. This is my...second(?) time making something in JavaScript, and its probably some of the worst code I've ever written. <br> <br> <b>Addendum 2024-03-13: </b>I fixed it, the logic is no longer awful, I've kept the original in there for me to laugh at <br> <br> Last Updated: Y9S1</p>

<p>I've been trying to learn C, this is the first small little project I made in an afternoon. It's an implementation of a joke sorting algorithm that is ludicrously inefficient. Hopefully some bigger and more useful C programs will be coming soon, but for now enjoy my awful handling of pointers! <br> <br> Last Updated: 2024-06-14 </p>
