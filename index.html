<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hi! If you're using this site chances are you're either a friend of mine or I'm showing you something. This is just a website for me to put all of my web projects into, as listed below. Important to note that I am NOT a web dev, and my graphic design ability is next to non-existent, but hopefully this is at the least usable. If you have any suggestions please contact me on GitHub or my Tumblr blog (at the bottom of the page) <br> -CCynth1a she/her :3</p>

<!--Siege Randomiser-->

    </div>

    <p>I noticed that there wasn't an up-to-date randomiser for Rainbow Six, and since Ubisoft stupidly decided to disable the operator randomiser in Standard matches, I just made one myself. This is my...second(?) time making something in JavaScript, and its probably some of the worst code I've ever written. <br> <br> <b>Addendum 2024-03-13: </b>I fixed it, the logic is no longer awful, I've kept the original in there for me to laugh at <br> <br> Last Updated: Y9S1</p>

    <p>I sometimes enjoy taking photos in racing games, specifically Forza; here's a simple gallery that shows some of the ones I'm proud of. Sadly I lost a lot of my FH4 photos when I purged my reddit account, so all that's left is low resolution screenshots. I have no clue what I'm doing when it comes to photography, tips are appreciated! <br><br><br><br><br>Last Updated: 2024/03/14</p>

    <p>As anyone who plays videogames with me knows, I procrastinate playing a lot. It could be a game I absolutely adore and I will still find every excuse not to play it, and quite often end up saying "later", which has become somewhat legendary. So SINCE YOU KEEP NAGGING ME ABOUT IT, THIS IS WHEN LATER IS OKAY. I'LL TELL YOU WHEN LATER IS <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Last Updated: 2024-04-05</p>
