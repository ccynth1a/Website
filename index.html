<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Hi! If you're using this site chances are you're either a friend of mine or I'm showing you something. This is just a website for me to put all of my web projects into, as listed below. Important to note that I am NOT a web dev, and my graphic design ability is next to non-existent, but hopefully this is at the least usable. If you have any suggestions please contact me on GitHub or my Tumblr blog (at the bottom of the page) <br> -CCynth1a she/her :3</p>

</div>
</div>

  <p>I noticed that there wasn't an up-to-date randomiser for Rainbow Six, and since Ubisoft stupidly decided to disable the operator randomiser in Standard matches, I just made one myself. This is my...second(?) time making something in JavaScript, and its probably some of the worst code I've ever written. May fix at some point, maybe not, at least its maintainable so I can add more operators when the new update comes out <br> Last Updated: Y8S4</p>

  <p>Task at college wanted us to make a site about a music genre, so I made one about Eurobeat since I think there's a little more to talk about than most of the metal bands I'm into. Not particularly interesting or novel, I just wanted it on my website so I could test it on various devices <br> Last Updated: 2024/02/28</p>
