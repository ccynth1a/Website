<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>If you're just here for the rainbow six randomiser, click on the pages icon and there's a link to it. Besides that this is just a place for me to put my coding projects and learn how to use git, so expect to see awful commit logs and possibly the worst javascript ever written. <br> -CCynth1a she/her :3</p>

  <p>I noticed that there wasn't an up-to-date randomiser for Rainbow Six, and since Ubisoft stupidly decided to disable the operator randomiser in Standard matches, I just made one myself. This is my...second(?) time making something in JavaScript, and its probably some of the worst code I've ever written. May fix at some point, maybe not, at least its maintainable so I can add more operators when the new update comes out <br> Last Updated: Y8S4</p>

  <p>Task at college wanted us to make a site about a music genre, so I made one about Eurobeat since I think there's a little more to talk about than most of the metal bands I'm into. Not particularly interesting or novel, I just wanted it on my website so I could test it on various devices <br> Last Updated: 2024/02/28</p>
