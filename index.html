<p>Hi! If you're using this site chances are you're either a friend of mine or I'm showing you something. This is just a website for me to put all of my projects into, as listed below. Important to note that I am <b>NOT</b> a web dev, and my graphic design ability is next to non-existent, so this will function more like a <b>"Document Viewer"</b> than an actual website. If you have any suggestions please contact me on GitHub or my Email (at the bottom of the page) <br> -CCynth1a she/her :3</p>

<a href="r6randomiser.html"><h2>Rainbow Six Siege Randomiser</h2></a>

<p>I noticed that there wasn't an <b>up-to-date randomiser for Rainbow Six</b>, and since Ubisoft stupidly decided to disable the operator randomiser in Standard matches, I just made one myself. This is my...second<b>(?)</b> time making something in JavaScript, and its probably some of the worst code I've ever written. <br> <br> <b>Addendum 2024-03-13: </b>I fixed it, the logic is no longer awful, I've kept the original in there for me to laugh at <br> <br> <b>Last Updated: Y9S1</b></p>

<a href="https://github.com/ccynth1a/Mako"><h2>Mako</h2></a>

<p>A <b>basic web server</b>, but by far the beefiest project I've worked on up to this point, and also the clunkiest. Quite a bit of the code has been stolen and malformed from various sources into a Frankenstein's monster of a program that PROBABLY does what it's meant to, but I'm proud of it regardless. More information can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ccynth1a/Mako/blob/main/README.md">README</a>. <br> <br> <b>Last Updated: 2024-06-10</b></p>

<a href="https://github.com/ccynth1a/timber"><h2>timber</h2></a>

<p>Timber is just a <b>C logger library</b> for personal usage, but I've put it on Github so I can more easily clone it from my different computers. It will have a few more features added over time, but for now it's in a workable state and I'm happy with it! Hopefully my progress in C from the last project to this one is evident <br> <br> <b>Last Updated: 2024-09-11</b></p>

<a href="https://github.com/ccynth1a/proverbs-go"><h2>proverbs-go</h2></a>

<p><b>A rewrite of the UNIX program "Fortune"</b>, Proverbs is the result of my first day learning Go. So far it's been amazing, the language seems about halfway between C and Python, it's definitely got a focus on readability of syntax too. Honestly the most amazing thing is not having segfaults every time I use strings; this program is pretty string heavy, yet I didn't have a single crash. And portable networking code??? That only takes like 2 functions??? Not sure if this is heresy or not. Hoping to learn more Go in the future, but for now Proverbs is gonna stay public until I make something impressive (in the works). <br> <br> <b>Last Updated: 2024-09-25</b></p>
